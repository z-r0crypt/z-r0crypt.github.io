      <description>Tool Link: https://github.com/z-r0crypt/SSSD-extract Using this bash script it is possible to extract Active Directory accounts hashes when credential caching is enabled in SSSD.
$ zsh sssd-extract.sh [$FolderPath]  Without input arguments it takes the SSSD default path /var/lib/sss/db/ but you can use a different one. If tdbdump is not installed it just lists the ldb files which contain the hashes, you can install it apt install tdb-tools or exfiltrate these files:</description>

      <description>Command Execution exec - Returns last line of commands output passthru - Passes commands output directly to the browser system - Passes commands output directly to the browser and returns last line shell_exec - Returns commands output \`\` (backticks) - Same as shell_exec() popen - Opens read or write pipe to process of a command proc_open - Similar to popen() but greater degree of control pcntl_exec - Executes a program  PHP Code Execution Apart from eval there are other ways to execute PHP code: include/require can be used for remote code execution in the form of Local File Include and Remote File Include vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Microcorruption CTF - Tutorial</title>

      <description>Introduction In this post I will share my learnings and research work done during microcorruption CTF challenge.
What is Microcorruption? It&amp;rsquo;s an embedded security CTF challenge where you are given a debugger and a device (a smart lock), you will be given different levels of challenges to unlock the device, find flgs, find code vulnerabilitys, memory corruption bugs etc.
You&amp;rsquo;ll use the debugger to reverse-engineer the code for each level.</description>

      <description>Week 1. This week&amp;rsquo;s topic is an overview of what cryptography is about as well as our first example ciphers. You will learn about pseudo-randomness and how to use it for encryption. We will also look at a few basic definitions of secure encryption.
 History Discrete Probability  Birthday paradox  Stream Ciphers  Information theoretic security  Stream Ciphers PRG Attacks on OTP / stream ciphers Modern broken stream ciphers Better modern stream cipher Letâ€™s do some Salsa!</description>

      <description>Welcome!
In this site I will be sharing my learning and experiences i gained during a pentest, a CTF, wargame or any security challenges, basically everything i learn or want to learn. Hoping to help someone in similar situations and get feedback from you!</description>
