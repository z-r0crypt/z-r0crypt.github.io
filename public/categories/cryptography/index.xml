      <description>Week 1. This week&amp;rsquo;s topic is an overview of what cryptography is about as well as our first example ciphers. You will learn about pseudo-randomness and how to use it for encryption. We will also look at a few basic definitions of secure encryption.
 History Discrete Probability  Birthday paradox  Stream Ciphers  Information theoretic security  Stream Ciphers PRG Attacks on OTP / stream ciphers Modern broken stream ciphers Better modern stream cipher Let’s do some Salsa!</description>
