      <title>Microcorruption CTF - Tutorial</title>

      <description>Introduction In this post I will share my learnings and research work done during microcorruption CTF challenge.
What is Microcorruption? It&amp;rsquo;s an embedded security CTF challenge where you are given a debugger and a device (a smart lock), you will be given different levels of challenges to unlock the device, find flgs, find code vulnerabilitys, memory corruption bugs etc.
You&amp;rsquo;ll use the debugger to reverse-engineer the code for each level.</description>

      <title>Cryptography I - Stanford University - Week 1</title>

      <description>Week 1. This week&amp;rsquo;s topic is an overview of what cryptography is about as well as our first example ciphers. You will learn about pseudo-randomness and how to use it for encryption. We will also look at a few basic definitions of secure encryption.
 History Discrete Probability  Birthday paradox  Stream Ciphers  Information theoretic security  Stream Ciphers PRG Attacks on OTP / stream ciphers Modern broken stream ciphers Better modern stream cipher Let’s do some Salsa!</description>

      <description>Welcome!
In this site I will be sharing my learning and experiences i gained during a pentest, a CTF, wargame or any security challenges, basically everything i learn or want to learn. Hoping to help someone in similar situations and get feedback from you!</description>
